that	0	0
anymore	0	0

it's	0	0
not	0	0

there're	0	0

there	0	0
were	0	0

And	0	0
it	0	0
was	0	0
just	0	0
a	0	0
great	0	0
place	0	0
to	0	0
pretend	0	0
and	0	0
we	0	0
would	0	0
climb	0	0
up	0	0
on	0	0
the	0	0

on	0	0
the	0	0

we	0	0
had	0	0

Kathy	0	0
had	0	0
one	0	0

And	0	0
that's	0	0
really	0	0
all	0	0
I	0	0
remember	0	0
about	0	0
that	0	0
night	0	0
,	0	0
it	0	0
was	0	0
just	0	0
a	0	0
lot	0	0
of	0	0

We	0	0
would	0	0
also	0	0
drink	0	0

I	0	GATE_agent
would	0	0

between	0	0
the	0	0
ages	0	0
of	0	0
7	0	0

10	0	0

was	0	0
a	0	0
really	0	0

to	0	0
go	0	0
to	0	0
the	0	0

the	0	0

we	0	0

30	0	0

only	0	0
had	0	0

we	0	0
,	0	0

we	0	GATE_agent

I	0	GATE_agent
don't	0	0

if	0	0
it	0	0
was	0	0

We	0	0

we	0	0
went	0	0
out	0	0
one	0	0
night	0	0
to	0	0
the	0	0

,	0	0
but	0	0
before	0	0
we	0	0
went	0	0
to	0	0
the	0	0
movie	0	0
we	0	0
went	0	0
to	0	0
get	0	0

and	0	0
then	0	0
we	0	0
went	0	0
to	0	0
,	0	0
and	0	0
I	0	GATE_agent
think	0	0
the	0	0
name	0	0
of	0	0
the	0	0
place	0	0
was	0	0
The	0	0
Open	0	0

we	0	0
didn't	0	0
have	0	0

we	0	0

all	0	0
that	0	0
.	0	0

Um	0	0
,	0	0
also	0	0
we	0	0
did	0	0
a	0	0
lot	0	0
of	0	0
pretending	0	0
and	0	0
as	0	0
I	0	GATE_agent
said	0	0
we	0	0
played	0	0
career	0	0
girls	0	0
and	0	0
the	0	0
dress	0	0
ups	0	0
.	0	0

I	0	0
lived	0	0
in	0	0
the	0	0
Dilworth	0	0
area	0	0
,	0	0
and	0	0
we	0	0
would	0	0
go	0	0
to	0	0
the	0	0
Dilworth	0	0
Theatre	0	0
and	0	0
I	0	GATE_agent
do	0	0
remember	0	0
that	0	0
it	0	0
cost	0	0
9	0	0
cents	0	0
to	0	0
get	0	0
a	0	0
ticket	0	0
to	0	0
get	0	0
in	0	0
.	0	0

And	0	0
when	0	0
I	0	0
was	0	0
young	0	0
,	0	0
it	0	0
wasn't	0	0
a	0	0
strange	0	0
thing	0	0
for	0	0
the	0	0
kids	0	0
to	0	0
just	0	0
go	0	0
off	0	0
and	0	0
go	0	0
to	0	0
a	0	0
movie	0	0
.	0	0

And	0	0
in	0	0
the	0	0
yard	0	0
,	0	0
we	0	0
had	0	0
an	0	0
old	0	0
tree	0	0
that	0	0
had	0	0
been	0	0
cut	0	0
down	0	0
and	0	0
just	0	0
the	0	0
stump	0	0
was	0	0
remaining	0	0
and	0	0
my	0	0
mother	0	0
had	0	0
planted	0	0
,	0	0
um	0	0
,	0	0
flowers	0	0
all	0	0
around	0	0
that	0	0
stump	0	0
and	0	0
we	0	0
would	0	0
use	0	0
that	0	0
stump	0	0
as	0	0
a	0	0
,	0	0
as	0	0
a	0	0
throne	0	0
and	0	0
the	0	0
princess	0	0
got	0	0
to	0	0
sit	0	0
up	0	0
on	0	0
that	0	0
stump	0	0
on	0	0
that	0	0
throne	0	0
and	0	0
have	0	0
all	0	0
those	0	0
flowers	0	0
around	0	0
her	0	0
and	0	0
that	0	0
would	0	0
be	0	0
the	0	0
throne	0	0
and	0	0
she	0	0
would	0	0
be	0	0
the	0	0
queen	0	0
or	0	0
the	0	0
princess	0	0
or	0	0
whatever	0	0
.	0	0

So	0	0
they	0	0
would	0	0
fill	0	0
little	0	0
bags	0	0
for	0	0
us	0	0
and	0	0
we	0	0
would	0	0
give	0	0
them	0	0
a	0	0
nickel	0	0
and	0	0
we	0	0
could	0	0
take	0	0
that	0	0
to	0	0
the	0	0
movie	0	0
theatre	0	0
with	0	0
us	0	0
.	0	0

And	0	0
we	0	0
went	0	0
to	0	0
Open	0	0
Kitchen	0	0
and	0	0
we	0	0
would	0	0
have	0	0
eight	0	0
or	0	0
10	0	0
girls	0	0
and	0	0
we	0	0
would	0	0
order	0	0
one	0	0

and	0	0
all	0	0
share	0	0
it	0	0
and	0	0
everyone	0	0
would	0	0
only	0	0
get	0	0
one	0	0
piece	0	0
and	0	0
I	0	GATE_agent
think	0	0
we	0	0
would	0	0
make	0	0
the	0	GATE_agent
waitresses	0	GATE_agent
mad	0	0
because	0	0
we	0	0
didn't	0	0
have	0	0
money	0	0
to	0	0
leave	0	0

But	0	0
we	0	0

we	0	0
remained	0	0
close	0	0

No	0	0
,	0	0
huh-uh	0	0
.	0	0

Is	0	0
that	0	0
for	0	0
real	0	0
?	0	0

And	0	0
we	0	0
would	0	0
go	0	0
to	0	0
work	0	0

pretend	0	0
we	0	0
had	0	0
an	0	0

then	0	0
when	0	0
we	0	0

we	0	0

And	0	0
then	0	0
we	0	0
moved	0	0
to	0	0
Charlotte	0	0
and	0	0
we	0	0
used	0	0
to	0	0
go	0	0
to	0	0
And	0	0
it	0	0
was	0	0
really	0	0
beautiful	0	0
and	0	0
I	0	GATE_agent
really	0	0

really	0	0
wanted	0	0

They're	0	0
going	0	0
to	0	0
melt	0	0
!	0	0

Did	0	0
Betty	0	0
Belle	0	0
turn	0	0

In	0	0
fact	0	0
we	0	0
shared	0	0
an	0	0

,	0	0
first	0	0
apartment	0	0
either	0	0
one	0	0
of	0	0
us	0	0
ever	0	0
had	0	0
.	0	0

And	0	0
we	0	0
would	0	0
go	0	0
over	0	0
to	0	0
my	0	0
grandparents'	0	0
and	0	0
they	0	0
had	0	0
a	0	0
a	0	0
big	0	0
white	0	0
house	0	0
with	0	0
a	0	0
big	0	0
front	0	0
porch	0	0
and	0	0
,	0	0
uh	0	0
,	0	0
banisters	0	0
on	0	0
it	0	0
and	0	0
a	0	0
lot	0	0
of	0	0
rocking	0	0
chairs	0	0
out	0	0
on	0	0
the	0	0
front	0	0
porch	0	0
.	0	0

We	0	0
would	0	0
get	0	0
maybe	0	0
15	0	0
cents	0	0
each	0	0
to	0	0
go	0	0
to	0	0
the	0	0
movie	0	0
,	0	0
and	0	0
I	0	0
sound	0	0
like	0	0
I'm	0	0
95	0	0
years	0	0
old	0	0

So	0	0
it	0	0
wasn't	0	0
a	0	0
good	0	0
situation	0	0
for	0	0
the	0	0
waitresses	0	0
,	0	0
but	0	0
we	0	GATE_agent
had	0	0
fun	0	0
and	0	0
we	0	GATE_agent
didn't	0	0
even	0	0
think	0	0
about	0	0
it	0	0
.	0	0

with	0	0
those	0	0
kinds	0	0
of	0	0
prices	0	0
.	0	0

Um	0	0
,	0	0
but	0	0
we	0	0
would	0	0
go	0	0
to	0	0
the	0	0
movie	0	0
and	0	0
then	0	0
you	0	0
would	0	0
go	0	0
in	0	0
and	0	0
get	0	0
your	0	0
,	0	0
your	0	0
snack	0	0
that	0	0
you	0	GATE_agent

.	0	0

But	0	0
we	0	0
would	0	0
switch	0	0
playing	0	0
Robin	0	0
Hood	0	0
,	0	0
one	0	0
would	0	0
play	0	0
Robin	0	0

and	0	0
one	0	0
would	0	0
play	0	0
Saretha	0	0
.	0	0

And	0	0
the	0	0
way	0	0
we	0	0
decided	0	0
who	0	0
got	0	0
to	0	0
wear	0	0
it	0	0
first	0	0
,	0	0
and	0	0
this	0	0
always	0	0
kind	0	0
of	0	0
bothered	0	0
me	0	GATE_agent
because	0	0
I	0	GATE_agent

and	0	0
we	0	0
went	0	0
into	0	0
the	0	0

;	0	0
we're	0	0

And	0	0
there	0	0
was	0	0
one	0	0
other	0	0
sucker	0	0
that	0	0
cost	0	0
a	0	0
nickel	0	0
and	0	0
we	0	0
called	0	0
that	0	0
an	0	0
all	0	0
day	0	0
sucker	0	0
,	0	0
just	0	0
because	0	0
you	0	0
couldn't	0	0
eat	0	0
the	0	0
whole	0	0

for	0	0
the	0	0
entire	0	0

really	0	0
just	0	0
have	0	0
that	0	0

.	0	0

So	0	0
we	0	0
would	0	0
go	0	0
every	0	0
Saturday	0	0
morning	0	0
.	0	0

Except	0	0
these	0	0
were	0	0
2	0	0
cents	0	0
because	0	0
they	0	0
had	0	0
the	0	0
Tootsie	0	0
Roll	0	0
in	0	0
the	0	0
middle	0	0
.	0	0

And	0	0
I	0	0
had	0	0
a	0	0
group	0	GATE_agent
of	0	GATE_agent
girlfriends	0	GATE_agent
that	0	GATE_agent
I	0	GATE_agent
ran	0	GATE_agent
around	0	GATE_agent
with	0	GATE_agent
and	0	0
there	0	0
were	0	0
,	0	0
golly	0	0
,	0	0
there	0	0
might've	0	0
been	0	0
8	0	0
to	0	0
10	0	0

us	0	0
who	0	0
were	0	0
good	0	0

And	0	0
my	0	0
brothers	0	0
and	0	0
myself	0	0
were	0	0
not	0	0
the	0	0
only	0	0
people	0	0

this	0	0
;	0	0
all	0	0
the	0	0
kids	0	0
that	0	0

to	0	0
do	0	0
this	0	0
.	0	0

And	0	0
we	0	0
would	0	0
,	0	0
could	0	0
go	0	0
to	0	0
the	0	0
movie	0	0
.	0	0

So	0	0
if	0	0
you	0	0
missed	0	0
one	0	0
Saturday	0	0
you	0	0
would	0	0
miss	0	0
what	0	0
happened	0	0
in	0	0
a	0	0
particular	0	0
episode	0	0
and	0	0
you	0	GATE_agent
,	0	0
um	0	0
,	0	0
wouldn't	0	0
know	0	0
what	0	0
had	0	0
taken	0	0
place	0	0
.	0	0

We	0	0
just	0	0
did	0	0
what	0	0
we	0	0
could	0	0
get	0	0
away	0	0
with	0	0
.	0	0

And	0	0
we	0	GATE_agent
didn't	0	0
even	0	0
have	0	0
to	0	0
ask	0	0
for	0	0
it	0	0
because	0	0
the	0	0
bakery	0	0
lady	0	0
knew	0	0
us	0	0
and	0	0
she	0	0
knew	0	0
to	0	0

And	0	0
I	0	0
really	0	0
hope	0	0
that	0	0
my	0	0
daughters	0	0
have	0	0
had	0	0
some	0	0
nights	0	0
like	0	0
that	0	0

.	0	0

And	0	0
also	0	0
at	0	0
this	0	0
theater	0	0
,	0	0
they	0	0
gave	0	0

to	0	0
different	0	0
people	0	0
.	0	0

And	0	0
I	0	0
just	0	0
remember	0	0
seeing	0	0
,	0	0
and	0	0
I	0	0
was	0	0
sitting	0	0
in	0	0
a	0	0
middle	0	0
section	0	0
,	0	0
I	0	0
was	0	0
not	0	0
on	0	0
an	0	0

so	0	0
I	0	0
had	0	0
girls	0	0
I	0	0
knew	0	0
on	0	0
both	0	0
sides	0	0
of	0	0
me	0	0
.	0	0

And	0	0
one	0	0
other	0	0
form	0	0
of	0	0
refreshment	0	0
that	0	0
we	0	0
got	0	0
,	0	0
which	0	0
really	0	0
embarrassed	0	0
my	0	GATE_agent
mother	0	GATE_agent
because	0	0
she	0	GATE_agent
didn't	0	0
know	0	0
anything	0	0
about	0	0
this	0	0
until	0	0
she	0	0
went	0	0
with	0	0
us	0	0
to	0	0
the	0	0
movie	0	0
one	0	0
Saturday	0	0

But	0	0
for	0	0
some	0	0
reason	0	0
,	0	0
and	0	0
I	0	GATE_agent
think	0	0
this	0	0
is	0	0
really	0	0
true	0	0
,	0	0
he	0	0
got	0	0
ice	0	0

And	0	0
one	0	0
time	0	0
I	0	GATE_agent
can	0	0
remember	0	0
,	0	0
I	0	GATE_agent
think	0	0

um	0	0

,	0	0
I	0	GATE_agent
don't	0	0
even	0	0

what	0	0
all	0	0

of	0	0

lollipops	0	0
is	0	0
what	0	0
they	0	0
call	0	0
them	0	0
now	0	0
,	0	0
but	0	0
we	0	0
called	0	0
them	0	0
suckers	0	0
and	0	0
we	0	0
would	0	0
get	0	0
often	0	0
a	0	0
2-cent	0	0
sucker	0	0
.	0	0

We	0	0
would	0	0
go	0	0
into	0	0
the	0	0
bakery	0	0
and	0	0
we	0	GATE_agent
would	0	0
ask	0	0
for-	0	0
-a	0	0
nickel	0	0
worth	0	0
of	0	0
scraps	0	0
!	0	0

And	0	0
that	0	0
was	0	0
another	0	0
game	0	0
that	0	0
Jill	0	0
and	0	0
I	0	0
used	0	0
to	0	0
play	0	0
;	0	0
we	0	0
would	0	0
pretend	0	0
we	0	0
were	0	0
in	0	0
the	0	0
jungle	0	0
and	0	0
we	0	0
would	0	0
climb	0	0
up	0	0

and	0	0
pretend	0	0
it	0	0
was	0	0
our	0	0
elephant	0	0
.	0	0

Also	0	0
about	0	0
that	0	0
same	0	0
time	0	0
period	0	0
in	0	0
my	0	0
life	0	0
,	0	0
I	0	GATE_agent
guess	0	0
again	0	0
between	0	0
seven	0	0
and	0	0
ten	0	0
years	0	0
old	0	0
,	0	0
which	0	0
seems	0	0
to	0	0
be	0	0
what	0	0
I	0	GATE_agent
remember	0	0
most	0	0
vividly	0	0
,	0	0
my	0	0
best	0	0
friend	0	0
uh	0	0
,	0	0
was	0	0
Kathy	0	GATE_agent
Josey	0	GATE_agent

and	0	0
she	0	0
was	0	0
a	0	0
next	0	0
door	0	0
neighbor	0	0
also	0	0
,	0	0
and	0	0
we	0	GATE_agent
remained	0	0
friends	0	0
up	0	0
until	0	0
,	0	0
uh	0	0
,	0	0
she	0	0
was	0	0
about	0	0
35	0	0
and	0	0
she	0	0
passed	0	0
away	0	0
with	0	0
cancer	0	0
.	0	0

And	0	0
that's	0	0
all	0	0
the	0	0
stories	0	0
I	0	GATE_agent
can	0	0
remember	0	0
about	0	0
the	0	0
movies	0	0
right	0	0
now	0	0
.	0	0

And	0	0
the	0	0
big	0	0
group	0	0
of	0	0
people	0	0
would	0	0
go	0	0
stand	0	0
on	0	0
the	0	0
stairs	0	0
and	0	0
there	0	0
would	0	0
be	0	0
probably	0	0
30	0	0
or	0	0
40	0	0
kids	0	0
in	0	0
the	0	0
picture	0	0
.	0	0

I	0	GATE_agent
do	0	0
know	0	0
that	0	0
I	0	0
did	0	0
used	0	0
to	0	0
go	0	0
the	0	0
movie	0	0
downtown	0	0
at	0	0
the	0	0
Carolina	0	0
Theatre	0	0

Are	0	0
you	0	0
making	0	0

?	0	0

Like	0	0
a	0	0
box	0	0
of	0	0
ice	0	0
cream	0	0
sandwiches	0	0
.	0	0

Um	0	0
,	0	0
and	0	0
we	0	0
would	0	0
,	0	0
had	0	0
that	0	0
many	0	0
girls	0	0
but	0	0
we	0	0
would	0	0
only	0	0
go	0	0
out	0	0
in	0	0
a	0	0
couple	0	0
of	0	0
cars	0	0
and	0	0
I	0	GATE_agent
remember	0	0
one	0	0
of	0	0
the	0	0
girls	0	0
,	0	0
Betty	0	0
Belle	0	0
,	0	0
her	0	0
dad	0	0
had	0	0
a	0	0
VW	0	0
Beetle	0	0
,	0	0
and	0	0
we'd	0	0
fit	0	0
like	0	0
5	0	0
girls	0	0
in	0	0
that	0	0
VW	0	0
Beetle	0	0
.	0	0

No	0	0
,	0	0
I	0	GATE_agent
love	0	0
this	0	0
story	0	0
.	0	0

And	0	0
it	0	0
had	0	0
real	0	0
large	0	0
,	0	0
thick	0	0
branches	0	0
extending	0	0
out	0	0
to	0	0
the	0	0
side	0	0
and	0	0
they	0	0
were	0	0
fat	0	0
enough	0	0
branches	0	0
where	0	0
as	0	0
a	0	0
child	0	0
of	0	0
eight	0	0
and	0	0
nine	0	0
years	0	0
old	0	0
we	0	0
could	0	0
straddle	0	0
the	0	0
branches	0	0
.	0	0

So	0	0
,	0	0
it	0	0
,	0	0
that	0	0
became	0	0
a	0	0
normal	0	0
thing	0	0
with	0	0
us	0	0
.	0	0

And	0	0
of	0	0
course	0	0
there's	0	0
